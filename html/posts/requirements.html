                <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction to project background and client</h2>
                <p>Our client is Ocado. It is an online supermarket where people can shop grocery online and their
                    grocery will be delivered to their doorstep. Shoppers can express their opinions on the products by
                    writing reviews on the company’s website. Our project is oriented around investigating into this
                    review system.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Project goal</h2>
                <p>Our project goal is to investigate and design various natural language processing models for the
                    review system on Ocado’s website. In other words, the goal is to design machine learning algorithms
                    that can accurately correlate between a review’s text and its rating or helpfulness score. </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Requirement gathering
                </h2>
                <p>The requirements given on the project task sheet were unclear, so we arranged a video
                    conference meeting with our client. During the meeting, they gave us a list of requirements and told
                    us which requirements we must achieve and which requirements are of lower priority. In subsequent
                    meetings we further clarified any ambiguities and updated the requirements list as needed.</p>

                <p>To gather our requirements and any other crucial information from our client we prepared a list of
                    questions to ask before each meeting.
                    Here is an example list of the questions we prepared for one of the meetings:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What kind of application/user interface?</li>
                    <li>Do we need to do the visualisation for reviews?</li>
                    <li>Do we need to encourage users to review?</li>
                    <li>What is generation and summarization(research level)?</li>
                    <li>Ask clients to give data.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Adam Smith is a 25 year old software engineer who manages and develops code for various aspects
                    of his organisation's processes.
                    Part of his job is to research and implement new possible innovations that could improve the
                    company's performance.
                    He is very proficient with programming in many languages including python and implementing new
                    ideas into the system.
                    If given someone's code to work with he'd appreciate if it was clear, well structured and
                    flexible so that he can easily adapt
                    what is useful and make any necessary refactoring or debugging without severe headaches.

                <p>Ben Johnson is a 35 year old administrator of the review system on his company's website. He
                    doesn't understand languages like python as deeply as Adam
                    but he is familiar with webpage related languages like HTML. His task is to manage and maintain
                    the review section of the website and make sure that it
                    fulfills its purpose of informing customers looking through the products. The natural language
                    processing research can be useful to him but he may need some
                    important visualisations of the analysis results.

                        important discoveries.

                    <li>Uses the delivered NLP source code as they see fit. This means they could:

                        <li>Refactor it if the delivered code is slightly not in the right form to be used for Ocado’s

                        </li>
                        <li>Execute it. They could have a pre trained program or train it themselves manually.
                        </li>
                        <li>There should also be infrastructure provided by us to test the NLP program in good detail.

                    </ol>
                    <li>They can insert some of their review data from their website into the program.
                    </li>
                    <li>Potentially could brief the Review System Admin on any important information they know
                        themselves or even help the RSA with the source code.

                <ol>
                    <li>Like software engineer, they can read the contents of the research report to
                        be better able to understand the NLP solutions we came up with and why they are the best.
                    </li>
                    <li>As the admin of the review system they can also provide review data that
                        they have access to to parse as input into the NLP program.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make use of the visualisations of the review analysis results as they see fit.
