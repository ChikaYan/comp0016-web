                <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction to project background and client</h2>
                <p>Our client is Ocado. It is an online supermarket where people can shop grocery online and their
                    grocery will be delivered to their doorstep. Shoppers can express their opinions on the products by
                    writing reviews on the company’s website. Our project is oriented around investigating into this
                    review system.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Project goal</h2>
                <p>Our project goal is to investigate and design various natural language processing models for the
                    review system on Ocado’s website. In other words, the goal is to design machine learning algorithms
                    that can accurately correlate between a review’s text and its rating or helpfulness score. </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Requirement gathering
                </h2>
                <p>The requirements given on the project task sheet were really unclear, so we arranged a video
                    conference meeting with our client. During the meeting, they gave us a list of requirements and told
                    us which requirements we must achieve and which requirements are of lower priority. In subsequent
                    meetings we further clarified any ambiguities and updated the requirements list as needed.</p>

                    <li>Adam Smith is a 25 year old software engineer who manages and develops code for various aspects
                        of his organisation's processes.
                        Part of his job is to research and implement new possible innovations that could improve the
                        company's performance.
                        He is very proficient with programming in many languages including python and implementing new
                        ideas into the system.
                        If given someone's code to work with he'd appreciate if it was clear, well structured and
                        flexible so that he can easily adapt
                        what is useful and make any necessary refactoring or debugging without severe headaches.

                        <li>Ben Johnson is a 35 year old administrator of the review system on his company's website. He
                        doesn't understand languages like python as deeply as Adam
                        but he is familiar with webpage related languages like HTML. His task is to manage and maintain
                        the review section of the website and make sure that it
                        fulfills its purpose of informing customers looking through the products. The natural language
                        processing research can be useful to him but he may need some
                        important visualisations of the analysis results.

                <ol>
                    <li>Read the contents of the research data produced by us so they get the best picture possible of 
                        the NLP situation for the review system, what NLP models work best and other interesting or important discoveries.
                    </li>
                    <li>Uses the delivered NLP source code as they see fit. This means they could:

                    <ol type ="a">
                        <li>Refactor it if the delivered code is slightly not in the right form to be used for   Ocado’s needs.
                        </li>
                        <li>Execute it. They could have a pre trained program or train it themselves manually. 
                        </li>
                        <li>There should also be infrastructure provided by us to test the NLP program in good detail.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>They can insert some of their review data from their website into the program.
                    </li>
                    <li>Potentially could brief the Review System Admin on any important information they know themselves or even help the RSA with the source code.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                    <li>Like software engineer, they can read the contents of the research report to 
                        be better able to understand the NLP solutions we came up with and why they are the best.
                    </li>
                    <li>As the admin of the review system they can also provide review data that 
                        they have access to to parse as input into the NLP program.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make use of the visualisations of the review analysis results as they see fit.

                <h2 class="section-heading">User Case Diagram</h2>
                <p>As the application of our project involves many discrete steps, we agreed it would be more clear if
                    we express it using a flow chart.

                <ul>
                    <li>We must build up a machine learning model that can be used to predict the helpfulness and rating
                        based on the comment text.

                    <ul>
                        <li>We must use basic natural language processing techniques</li>
                        <li>We must produce some research on application of NLP in Ocado’s reviews (methodological and
                            experimental if possible).

                    <li>We should go further by building more accurate models to predict a review’s rating and
                        helpfulness.

                    <li>We could use Deep NLP techniques and develop our program into generation and summarization

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We could have a simple demo website that shows the outcomes of our program in a straightforward
