                <h2 class="section-heading">Existing Solutions</h2>
                <p>Our task consists of predicting the rating (from 1 star to 5 stars) and estimating the helpfulness
                    percentage (any number between 0 and 100) from a comment text. First one is considered to be a
                    classification problem, where you need to take an object and classify it into several different
                    categories. Second one is clearly a regression problem, where you need to predict a continuous
                    value. Since training data (which contains text, rating and helpfulness) will be used, both tasks
                    would be supervised learning. Thus, our project would focus on supervised machine learning on both
                    classification and regression, and of course natural language processing. [1]
                </p>

                <p>Since above questions are very typical in machine learning, a lot of research has been done on them
                    and many great solutions exist.</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Bag of Words</h3>

                <p>In terms of natural language processing, the most straightforward way is “bag of words”, which simply
                    assigns each unique word with an index, and converts a piece of text into a vector that represents
                    occurrence of each word. [2] This is the best way for beginners to get started, but is also very
                    limited in performance due to the complexity of human language. For instance, when we say “good”,
                    “helpful” or “nice” we usually mean it’s good, but if we say “not good”, “can’t say it’s helpful”,
                    meaning of the sentence would be reversed. More advanced techniques are needed to deal with this
                    kind of situation.</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">N-grams</h3>
                <p>A better solution is n-grams. Instead of splitting text into individual words, it splits them into
                    lists of n consecutive words -- so “not good” will not become “not” “good” and potentially confuse
                    the algorithm. However, if we just use all the possible combinations of words, it will greatly slow
                    down the training algorithm, and most of the result wouldn’t be useful (like “would not” or “not
                    say”). So an important part of n-gram is to predict the occurrence of next word, and use the result
                    to decide if the actual next word should be included in an n-gram sentence or not. [3]</p>

                <p>There also exists much more advanced solutions like deep natural language processing. Some small
                    tricks, such as excluding meaningless words (“a”, “the”, “and”, etc) and counting frequencies
                    instead of occurrence, can also help a lot in improving the processing speed and accuracy.</p>

                <p>NLP (Natural Language Processing) solutions are used to convert text into numeric representations
                    that can be used by another code. It is the machine learning algorithm that handles the actual
                    training and application of the model.</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Linear Regression</h3>

                <p>The most basic machine learning would be linear regression. It is a model that assumes a linear
                    relationship between variables (x) and value (f(x)). For model with one variable only, it is as
                    simple as solving the equation f(x) = m * x + c, finding the value of m and c and using them to
                    predict f(x) for some x that’s unknown.[4] However, for our project, variable is a list of numbers
                    that represent occurrence of different words/n-gram sentences, and things can get more complicated
                    with multiple variables. That’s when techniques like cost function and gradient descent come into
                    place. [5]</p>

                <p>The idea of cost function is that: since the actual data won’t always fit into a perfect line (even
                    if they have a very strong linear relationship), our goal is to find a hypothesis function h(x),
                    which predicts the value from x as accurate as possible. And the accuracy is measure by cost
                    function. It simply calculates the average difference between the actual value and the value
                    predicted by h(x). If we can find a h(x) with minimal cost, that h(x) would be the most accurate
                    model. [6]</p>

                <p>In order to reduce the cost, gradient descent is used. It first selects a point on cost function
                    graph and uses differentiation to find the direction towards local minimum point. It then changes
                    the constants of h(x) (which are the variables in cost function) bit by bit, so the function
                    gradually approaches the local minimal point (and for linear function local minimum is same as
                    global minimum). Once it reaches minimal, the variable values of cost function will be used as
                    constants in h(x), and a hypothesis with good accuracy is produced. [7]</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Logistic Regression</h3>

                <p>Although linear regression is great, it’s not ideal for classification problem, beacuse its range is
                    ±infinity since it’s a y = mx + c type of function, which is not desirable as we want to yield
                    probabilities of object x belonging to a certain class, which should always be between 0 and 1. As
                    such for our first model we decided to use logistic regression which remedies this problem. Logistic
                    regression always outputs values between 0 and 1. This is because its hypothesis function uses a
                    logistic function f(t) = 1 / (1 + e-t) where t is usually the output from what would’ve been the
                    hypothesis function in linear regression. [14] In fact, logistic regression works quite similarly to
                    linear regression. </p>

                <p>The cost function is also adapted using logarithms and when during training the hypothesis function’s
                    prediction is compared to the real value y, the cost approaches infinity as the difference between
                    h(x) and y approaches 1. In other words the more the hypothesis is incorrect, the more severe the
                    punishment (and rate of change of punishment increases drastically). [15]
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Related Technologies</h2>
                <p>Machine learning and NLP are very popular areas, there is a lot of sophisticated software. </p>

                <p>MATLAB is a programming language that heavily focuses on maths. It is matrix-based and can express
                    maths formula in a very natural way. It is often used to analyze data and develop algorithms. [8] It
                    is also possible to use MATLAB with other programming languages (e.g. Python). MATLAB is a very good
                    tool to learn maths behind machine learning, however, it also has some obvious drawbacks. Firstly,
                    it is not free, thus it can cause unnecessary charges to Ocado if they need to modify our program in
                    the future. Secondly, it is purely a tool for maths and research, and it doesn’t produce any
                    deployable applications. [9]</p>

                <p>Octave is a language similar to MATLAB. It’s usually used for solving mathematical problems and
                    automated data processing. One advantage it has over MATLAB is that it’s a free software, so no
                    budget is needed for using Ocative. [10] But it seems to have worse GUI, and it is still not good
                    for production. [11]</p>

                <p>Python is also a great tool for machine learning. Thanks to its open community, there are many
                    reliable libraries to support both machine learning and NLP. Besides, it is a popular language and
                    is very easy to learn. Unlike other two languages, python can build an application easily. However,
                    it is considered to have a slow computational speed, and it can generate a lot of runtime errors as
                    it’s a dynamic programming language. [8]</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">“Final” Decisions</h2>
                <p>Since our project is heavily research-based, we’re meant to constantly experiment with different
                    solutions and evaluate their performance. Thus our “final decisions” section would be quite
                    different from an ordinary project -- we would choose a certain programming language and stick with
                    it, but we won’t pick any particular methods of machine learning or NLP as our final decision.</p>

                <p>In terms of programming language, Python has been chosen for this project. Main reasons are: firstly,
                    all the team members have done Python last academic year, so we can get started more quickly with
                    Python. Since our project was already delayed for 2 months due to some contract issue, being able to
                    start quickly was very important for us. Secondly, our clients are more experienced with Python
                    machine learning and NLP, so we can seek help from them if we encountered any issues when learning.
                    Thirdly, Python is a free, open-source software, and it has a bunch of useful libraries and online
                    tutorials.</p>

                <p>As for the libraries, we decided to use NumPy, SciPy (which are needed for many maths-based
                    libraries, such as Pandas and Scikit-learn), Pandas (which is the best library for data processing.
                    Since we need to work with a huge amount of labelled data, Pandas can make things much easier) and
                    Scikit-learn, which is a very popular machine learning and NLP library. Scikit-learn contains many
                    useful algorithms for bag of words, n-gram, linear regression, logistic regression and so on, and it
                    also has a very well written documentation. [12] Thus we believe it will be very helpful when
                    learning and experimenting with different solutions.
                </p>

                <P>About the actual methods that we would use to implement the algorithm, as mentioned above, they are
                    not fixed and can vary as we progress. But for our first prototype, we decided to implement “bag of
                    words” from scratch to gain a better understanding of how everything works behind the scene, and we
                    would use logistic regression to train a model that predicts rating, which is a classification
                    problem.
                </P>

                <p>The reason why we decided not to do anything with linear regression and helpfulness prediction is
                    that linear regression is a very fundamental method and we don’t expect it to produce a very good
                    result. Besides, since behind the scenes both logistic and linear regression work very similarly, so
                    we only need to try one of them to get a good understanding of both. Moreover, since our project was
                    delayed for 5 weeks, we needed to find a balance in our available time and the prototype. We
                    negotiated with our clients about this and they are happy about our plan.
                </p>

                <p>Since our project is research-based, evaluating our machine learning model would be an essential
                    part. In order to demonstrate the algorithm better, we decided to use Jupyter Notebook, which is a
                    useful tool for live code demo and visualisation, to write the evaluation report. [13]
                </p>
