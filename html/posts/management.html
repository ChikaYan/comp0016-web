                <p>Handover date: 22nd Apr 2019</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Potential Liabilities</h3>
                <p>As a group, we have the following liabilities:</p>

                <p>Firstly and most importantly, We need to complete and deliver a project that satisfies the agreed
                    requirements by the
                    deadline. Based on our discussion about this project, the final requirements are delivering some
                    code that learns
                    from previous-labelled data and can be used to predict rating and helpfulness if the text of a
                    review is inputted,
                    as well as experimenting, evaluating and improving our code to producing some research reports. The
                    agreed deadline
                    for project submission is 23rd April, so we have to implement the above features and hand the code
                    to our clients
                    and UCL. In order to achieve that, we have made several milestones or quality gates to supervise our
                    progress, so
                    that as long as we work according to our plan, there won’t be any issue in finishing the work.</p>

                <p>Secondly, we should not distribute the materials and data given by our clients without their consent.
                    Since our
                    project involves Machine Learning on reviews, our clients have given us some materials from Ocado
                    for teaching
                    purposes. Considering they might be internal training materials and are protected by Copyright, we
                    definitely can’t
                    post them online or send them to other people. Similarly, we were also given Ocado’s website data to
                    train our
                    Machine Learning model. The data contains review information such as text, rating and customer ID.
                    Although this
                    information is posted on Ocado’s website and is visible to everyone, since it is from Ocado’s data
                    server, we
                    shouldn’t make it public without our clients’ permission.</p>

                <p>Thirdly, we should not make our work public without clients’ consent. The work here mainly means the
                    GitHub
                    repository we made for this project. It is our clients’ requirement to make the repository private,
                    as the review
                    data mentioned above is inside the repository and must be hidden from the public. Moreover,
                    according to the
                    contract, our clients will own all the code after we finish this module and Ocado might use it in
                    the future, it
                    depends on them whether the project will be Open Source or private.</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Intellectual Property Type</h3>

                <p>The most appropriate intellectual property type for this project would be Copyright. This is because
                    Copyright is
                    generally used to protect people’s original work and many software licenses are protected by it. In
                    comparison,
                    Trade Mark is usually used to protect an identifiable name for the product or company, and Patent is
                    used to protect
                    an original idea. Our project doesn’t really need an identifiable name because it won’t become very
                    famous. Besides,
                    since it involves code with Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques, which are
                    ideas that we
                    have to learn from other people, we are not able to protect the work with a Patent either.</p>

                <p>In terms of use of open source materials and our implementations, we have made use of many open
                    sources libraries
                    such as Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and Scikit-learn. They provide the necessary code for implementing our
                    program and
                    carrying out experiments on our work. Those libraries are all protected under Open Source license,
                    which means we
                    can use them for free as well as make changes to the code to satisfy our needs. On the other hand,
                    our own work
                    mainly consists of the code that makes use of those libraries to solve Machine Learning problems and
                    research
                    notebooks which record all the evaluations and analysis of our code.</p>

                <p>The source code agreement that I would suggest is Freeware. Since our code is produced by university
                    students and
                    won’t be used to profit directly, there is no reason to make it a Proprietary Software or Shareware.
                    Besides,
                    because our code contains the Ocado’s review data, which is considered as confidential information
                    and should be
                    kept private, we can’t make our project an OSS (Open Source Software). Hence, Freeware is the best
                    choice as it
                    allows our product to be used by everyone while keeps control over the source code. However, this
                    only serves as my
                    own suggestion to the clients. According to the contract, Ocado will own all the output of this
                    project and they
                    tend to keep software completely confidential and not open source. This policy also makes sense, as
                    they probably
                    don’t want their opponents to make use of those applications to either profit for themselves or
                    exploit Ocado’s
                    weakness.</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Data Privacy Consideration</h3>

                <p>The main concern of data privacy in our project is towards the usage of review data given by our
                    clients from Ocado.
                    The data is in the form of a CSV file and contains information about 0.4 million reviews left by
                    customers on
                    Ocado’s website. In order to protect the data privacy in our project, we would design and implement
                    the program
                    according to CDPR requirements. </p>

                <p>Firstly, we promote privacy and data protection in our project. We considered the issues regarding
                    the usage of this
                    data and discussed it with our clients. According to their requirements, we set our GitHub
                    repository to private to
                    protect the data file and we never leaked it to the public or shared it to anyone that’s not part of
                    our team.</p>

                <p>Secondly, we use appropriate methods to process our data. We have full control over where and how
                    data is processed.
                    We only use the data inside the project with the famous and trustable Python data science library
                    Pandas. We would
                    never pass the data to other programs that are unknown to us. By doing this, we can ensure the data
                    is used in the
                    correct and intended way.</p>

                <p>Thirdly, we ensure our program only processes the necessary data. For example, when doing rating
                    prediction from
                    review text, we only used columns of rating, review text and review title from Ocado review file,
                    while the other
                    columns such as user name and product ID are not processed at all.</p>

                <p>In the last place, since the data is from Ocado and was used in other Ocado’s software before, Ocado
                    should have
                    conducted the Privacy Impact Assessments before using this data. Thus, I believe as long as we use
                    the data in the
                    intended way and keep it private, we will not have any issue with data privacy.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">User Manual and Deployment Guide</h2>
                <p>The Python module is located at "./analyser", the pre-train models are stored at "./storage"</p>
                <p>To use the pre-trained models, install all requirements in requirements.txt and download those two folders. Then use Python 3 to run:</p>
