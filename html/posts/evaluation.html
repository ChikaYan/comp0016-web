                <h2 class="section-heading">Critical Evaluations</h2>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Functionality</h3>
                <p>We’ve designed a python module containing a ReviewAnalyser class that can be called to use the best
                    models we’ve
                    found to solve each problem. Its functionalities cover all you need to predict rating and
                    helpfulness -- you can
                    train new models either from direct input or CSV file, store them locally, read local storages into
                    memory and use
                    the models to do star rating and helpfulness prediction.</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Reproducibility/Stability</h3>
                <p>As an important part of our project, we have produced many research notes recorded in Jupyter
                    Notebooks. However,
                    they’re not exactly reproducible -- it’s difficult to run all the experiments again and get exactly
                    the same result
                    (the overall results and conclusions drawn from the experiments would still be correct, but the
                    numbers and details
                    of plots may vary).</p>

                <p>This is due to two reasons. First, running everything again would simply take too long, as many of
                    our experiments
                    are complicated require a lot of computational resources. Second, we decided not to fix a random
                    state for all the
                    models and data splittings. I.e., every time the experiments are run, different data will be used
                    and models will be
                    initialized with different parameters or weights. We made this decision because we want to
                    demonstrate the
                    unstableness in our models and eventually use them as an important part of evaluation as well.</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Efficiency and Maintainability</h3>
                <p>Since our code base is very simple, it’s very efficient to run and maintain. In addition, it is well
                    documented so
                    anyone can use and modify the code without any trouble.</p>

                <h3 style="font-style: italic">Project management</h3>
                <p>This project is well managed. We made our plans ahead and allocated different tasks to individuals.
                    We also set
                    deadlines for each other and made sure everyone was on the same page.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Future Work</h2>
                <p>We’d like to try many new things with this project if we had more time.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Running more experiments. Due to hardware limits and time complexity, we were not able to
                        experiment with all
                        possible combinations of hyperparameters. Instead, we found the optimal value for on
                        hyperparameter and assumed
                        it would work best even if other hyperparameters have changed. If we had more time and better
                        machines,
                        experimenting with all combinations rough Random Search Cross-Validation or Grid Search
                        Cross-Validation (for
                        features) might produce more accurate results.
                    </li>
                    <li>Testing more models on helpfulness problem. Since classification is more popular than regression
                        in ML, and our
                        data for review helpfulness contain many noise samples, we decided to put more time and effort
                        into star rating
                        classification problem instead. With more time, we could develop more on the helpfulness problem
                        and apply
                        techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network and Word Embedding on it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Learning and applying more models. There are still many powerful ML models that we haven’t
                        tried, such as
                        Supported Vector Machine, Recursive Neural Network etc. We’d love to learn and use them to solve
                        our problems.
                    </li>
                </ol>
